This Python script provides a simple quiz application with functionalities for user registration, login, password management, profile viewing, quiz attempts, and viewing quiz results. It interacts with a MySQL database to store and manage user data and quiz results.

Classes:
    Register: Handles database connection and provides methods for user registration, login, password changes, profile information display, quiz attempts, and retrieving quiz results.

Methods:
    __init__(self): Initializes the database connection.
    register(self, userName, password, name, phoneNumber): Registers a new user with the provided details.
    login(self, userName, password): Authenticates a user based on username and password.
    change_password(self, userName, password): Allows a user to change their password.
    show_profile(self, userName): Displays the profile information of a user.
    attempt_quiz(self, username, password): Facilitates a user to attempt a quiz and stores the result.
    getQuizResults(self, username): Retrieves and displays the quiz results for a user.

Usage:
    The script runs in a loop, presenting a menu with options to register, login, change password, view profile, attempt the quiz, view quiz results, and log out. The user interacts with the application through the console, making selections and entering information as prompted.

Dependencies:
    mysql-connector-python: Required for connecting to and interacting with the MySQL database.

Note:
    - The database connection details (host, username, password, database) are hardcoded and should be modified according to the user's database configuration.
    - The script includes placeholders for additional functionalities and fixes, indicated by TODO and FIXME comments.
    - Exception handling is implemented for database operations to manage errors gracefully.
    - The script is designed to run indefinitely until the user chooses to log out or terminates the program manually (e.g., through a KeyboardInterrupt).
